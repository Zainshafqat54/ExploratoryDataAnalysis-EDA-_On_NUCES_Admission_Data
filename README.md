## Preprocessing
The first step in this project is to perform preprocessing on the data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Once the preprocessing is complete, the next step is to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset. This includes generating various statistics and visualizations to better understand the distribution of the data and identify any patterns or relationships between variables.

## Tools Used
The following tools will be used in this project:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Conclusion
The results of the preprocessing and exploratory data analysis will provide valuable insights into the NUCES University admission process. This information can be used to make informed decisions about admission criteria and help improve the overall efficiency of the process.
